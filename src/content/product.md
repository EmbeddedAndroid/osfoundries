## Overview
The Zephyr and Linux microPlatforms are extensible software and hardware platforms that make it easier to develop, secure, and maintain Internet-connected embedded devices.

End-to-end Demonstration Systems shows you how to combine the microPlatforms with server and cloud applications to create complete systems. Using these systems, you can publish sensor data from devices to the cloud and perform firmware over the air (FOTA) updates of the device firmware.

## Linux microPlatform

The Linux microPlatform, based on OpenEmbedded / Yocto and Docker, is targeted at Linux-based devices.

## Zephyr microPlatform

The Zephyr microPlatform, based on the Zephyr real-time operating system, is targeted at microcontroller-based devices.
